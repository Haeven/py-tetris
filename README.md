# py-tetris
Tetris clone written in Python; This is a personal project I used to level-up my Python comfortability level past scripting purposes

# Install Python3
If you do not already have it installed, follow (this guide)[https://realpython.com/installing-python/] before moving on

# Install pygame
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

# Run the program
Use your CLI to `cd` into `/lib` and run the following:
```bash
python3 __init__.py
```
# Have fun!
Now you can play your very own local version of Tetris written entirely in Python using the pygame library
